# PorterOps: Porter Operator

PorterOps not only gives you a native, integrated experience for managing your
bundles with Kubernetes but is the recommended way to automate your bundle
pipeline with support for GitOps.

* Automate building and publishing bundles, when the bundle definition changes
  or new versions of images used by the bundle are available.
* Automatically deploy new versions of bundles.
* Isolated environments for running bundles in your organization, limiting
  access to secrets used by the bundles using namespaces and RBAC.
* Create and respond to events on your cluster to integrate bundles into your
  pipeline.

# Contact

* [Mailing List] - Great for following the project at a high level because it
  is low traffic, mostly release notes and blog posts on new features.
* [Slack] - Discuss #porter or #cnab with other users and the maintainers.
* [Open an Issue] - If you have a bug, feature request or question about Porter,
  ask on GitHub so that we can prioritize it and make sure you get an answer.
  If you ask on Slack, we will probably turn around and make an issue anyway. 😉

# Roadmap

Porter is an open-source project and things get done as quickly as we have
motivated contributors working on features that interest them. 😉

We use a single [project board][board] across all of our repositories to track
open issues and pull requests.

The roadmap represents what the core maintainers have said that they are
currently working on and plan to work on over the next few months. We use the
"on-hold" bucket to communicate items of interest that doesn't have a core
maintainer who will be working on it.
